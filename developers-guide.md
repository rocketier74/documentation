# Developer's Guide

_Please help out by updating this page_

### Operating System

It works on Mac OSX.
Probably works without any changes or issues on Linux.
Follow this [Windows installation guideline]({{site.url}}/install-jekyll-on-windows) for a detailed "How to install Ruby and Jekyll on Windows".

## Installation

### Clone the repo

{% highlight bash %}
git clone {{site.github_git}}
{% endhighlight %}

### Create a Ruby Gemset

Optional, but highly recommended.

{% highlight bash %}
$ rvm gemset create jekyll
$ echo 'rvm gemset use jekyll' >> .rvmrc
{% endhighlight %}

### Install Required Gems

{% highlight bash %}
gem install jekyll   # needed for testing building the site
gem install RedCloth # needed for .md rendering
gem install serve    # needed for resolving .html files w/o extension
gem install thin     # optional; more efficient webserver than Webrick but not strictly necessary
{% endhighlight %}


## Building and Viewing the Website

### Run jekyll

Open a terminal window, cd into the project folder and run jekyll from the project root.

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll build --watch
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to overwrite certain variables in the local environment, you can specify these variables in \_config\_local.yml, e.g. you can specify ```url: http://localhost:4000``` in \_config\_local.yml. To use the local config file start the build process as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll build --watch --config _config.yml,_config_local.yml
{% endhighlight %}

Leave this window running while you work.
Any time you change a file, jekyll will rerender it into the `_site` folder.
Changes to \_config.yml will only be recognized after a restart of the jekyll server.

### Run serve

Open another terminal window, cd into the project folder, then cd into the `_site` subfolder, and run

{% highlight bash %}
serve
{% endhighlight %}

This will start a webserver in the `_site` folder.
Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:4000/` and you should see the site.

## Minutiae and Other Trivialities

jekyll can take a second or two to catch up when you save a file.
If you edit a file and don't see the changes in your browser, give it a second or two and try again.
You may also see Maruku warnings, but as long as it prints `Successfully generated site` you should be alright.
